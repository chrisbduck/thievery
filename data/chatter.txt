Uh-oh...
Zoinks!
Time to go for a jog...
<sigh>
Whoops...

[player_death]
<gurgle>
I'll be back! <urgh>
Not again!
Ouch!
This didn't quite work out like I'd planned.
Now I will become more powerful than you could ever imagine!

[looted_chest]
More coins for the pile!
I love the taste of avarice in the evening.
Yummy money.
They won't be needing that any more.
Sleight makes right!
I wonder what I can buy with that.
Steal from the rich, give to... me!
I'll have that.
Yoink!
Please, sir... I want more!
Money money money... it's so lovely.

[pickpocketed_guard]
Change?  Anyone need some change?
Here's a bit of pocket money.
What's that in here?  Ewww...
He won't miss that.
Now there's a load off his pocket.

[won_level]
Eeeeeexcellent.
Now, where to put all this money?
It's a rich man's world.
Right - I'm outta here!
There is nothing quite as wonderful as money.
All your loot are belong to me.
