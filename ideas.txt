Ideas for thievery game
-----------------------

- 2D top-down game; single screen to start with
- Player controls a thief, out to wander around the screen and steal stuff from houses
- Guards wandering around the place will watch out for the player and chase them
- Can have a bit of text chatter from the guards
- Guards' visibility and hearing ranges and directions are the key
- Can have guard dogs as well - can smell the player from close range


Technical issues:
- Need to check reliably whether there's something between a guard and the player

Things the player can do:
- Walk around
- Throw daggers
- Close-range attack
- Steal something:
	- Rob a building
	- Pickpocket a guard
- Set a building on fire
- Set off a bomb

Stats:
	- Loot
	- Thefts, assaults, murders, etc

To do:
	- Hearing noises?
	- Suspicion?
